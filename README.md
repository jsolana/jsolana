## Hi there 👋

Hey! I'm Javi 😊, a software engineer passionate about building great products and solving complex problems. Since 2006, I've worked across various industries—including healthcare, public administration, gambling, and ride-hailing—gaining a deep understanding of how technology drives impact in different domains.

## 💼 Work Experience

With years of hands-on experience, I've tackled projects of all sizes, from monolithic architectures to microservices and event-driven systems. I enjoy designing scalable solutions that enhance both performance and user experience.

💡 Tech & Architectures I Work With:
- Software Architectures: Monoliths, Microservices, Event-Driven, Cloud-Native
- Programming Languages: C#, Java, Elixir, Node.js, Golang, Python, Bash scripting
- DevOps & Automation: GitOps, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines
- AI & Emerging Tech: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), AI-driven development


## 🔧 Skills

Beyond coding, I focus on strategic thinking, problem-solving, and user experience. Whether it's optimizing system performance, improving developer workflows, or ensuring a smooth user journey, I always keep the bigger picture in mind.
My work isn’t just about the “how,” but also the “why”—ensuring that we’re solving the right problems and delivering high-impact solutions.

- Team Leadership & Mentorship: I’m passionate about guiding teams, mentoring engineers, and fostering a collaborative, high-performance culture.
- Architectural Strategy: From high-level architecture to detailed implementation, I lead decisions on scalability, resilience, and performance to ensure we’re future-proofing solutions.
End-to-End Ownership: I take pride in owning the entire technical vision for products, ensuring seamless integration from backend to frontend and across all stages of the software lifecycle.

## 📚 Lifelong Learner

Technology evolves fast, and I love staying ahead of the curve. I’m always experimenting with new tools, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the community. The best part? Learning never stops! 🚀
